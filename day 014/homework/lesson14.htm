        <br>
        Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. 
        <br>Unqualified, the word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. 
        <br>Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, 
        <br>the United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football; 
        <br>gridiron football (specifically American football, arena football, or Canadian football);
        <br> International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby union football.
        <br>[1] These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as "football codes".
